12. The different states a process can be in within the XV6 operating system are :
    1. Unused : This state indicates that the process has not yet been allocated a process control block (PCB) or any memory.
    2. Embryo : This state is entered when a new process is created. In this state, the process has a PCB and some basic memory allocation, but it is not yet ready to run.
    3. Sleeping : A process enters the sleeping state when it is waiting for an event to occur, such as an I/O operation to complete or a signal to be received. The process is not running,                    but it can be awakened by the event it is waiting for.
    4. Runnable : A process enters the runnable state when it is ready to run and is waiting for the CPU to be assigned to it.
    5. Running : The state in which a process is actually executing instructions on the CPU. 
    6. Zombie : A process enters the zombie state when it has terminated, but its parent process has not yet called the wait() system call to collect its exit status.
       
13. The XV6 file system is a simple, single-user file system that is organized into inodes. An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file, such as its size, type, and permissions. Inodes are stored on disk, and each file in the file system is represented by a single inode. The file system also uses a directory structure to organize files and directories. A directory is a special type of file that contains a list of other files and directories. Directories are used to create a hierarchical structure of files and directories, which makes it easy to organize and find files. The roles of each of the XV6 components is listed below: 
    1. Inode : Inodes store information about files, such as their size, type, and permissions.
    2. Directories: Directories organize files and directories into a hierarchical structure.
    3. File table: Files keep track of all the open files in the system.
    4. Buffer cache: The buffer cache caches recently accessed file data in memory.
    5. Path names: Path names are used to identify files and directories in the file system. Path names are strings that consist of a sequence of file and directory names separated by              slashes.
    6. File descriptor layer: The file descriptor layer is responsible for managing file descriptors which are used to access open files.
    7. Disks : The file system stores data on disk, and the disk driver is responsible for reading and writing data to and from disk.
       
14. In the context of XV6, system calls and library functions are both mechanisms for requesting services from the operating system. However, they differ in their implementation and scope.
    System calls are low-level functions that provide direct access to the kernel, the core of the operating system. When a user program makes a system call, it triggers a transfer of          control from user space to kernel space, granting the kernel privileged access to hardware resources and system-wide data structures. System calls are typically used for tasks such as       file I/O, process management, and communication with other devices.
    Library functions, on the other hand, are implemented in user space and typically reside in shared libraries. They are designed to provide a higher-level abstraction over system calls,      simplifying common programming tasks and reducing the need to directly interact with the kernel. Library functions often call system calls internally to perform their operations.
